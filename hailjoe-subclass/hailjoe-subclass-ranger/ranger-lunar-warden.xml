			<p>The Oath of Palanthir is renowned for its dedication to safeguarding its comrades-in-arms. Originally known as the Knights of Palanthir, these holy warriors dispel the specter of defeat from the minds of their companions. Always bearing the sacred standard of their order, the Knights of Palanthir are celebrated for spreading tranquility and assurance wherever they tread.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF PALANTHIR</h5>
			<p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Palanthir vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Let not the Martyr rot.</em></strong> Preserve the honor of the martyr by ensuring that their body or remains never fall into the possession of our adversaries.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Die with the Standard.</em></strong> Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>First to charge, last to retreat.</em></strong> Lead by example on the battlefield, always at the forefront of the charge and the final to withdraw. Never leave the fight while any of your allies remain engaged in combat.</p>
