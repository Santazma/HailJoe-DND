    <supports>Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You summon three short-lived lightning elementals at unoccupied space within range. Although they are really creatures, and class features that affect summoning can treat them as such, in combat they are treated as small levitating objects with AC 16 and 15 hit points. The wraiths also shed dim light out to a radius of 10 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast the spell, you designate a direction for each wraith to travel in. Additionally, you can choose any number of creatures you can see to be ignored by the wraiths. At the end of each of your turns, the spark wraiths travel 30 feet in their chosen direction. If a wraith is ever within 10 feet of a creature that is small or larger, it emits a loud shriek and enters the nearest square of the creature's space, tethering itself to it.</p>
			<p class="indent">A tethered wraith moves with the targeted creature, but can still be attacked and take damage. At the start of each of its turns, a tethered creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 5d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature can only be tethered by one spark wraith; other spark wraiths ignore tethered creatures. The tether is broken if the spark wraith dissipates.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the spark wraith collides with an obstacle that is 5 feet or wider before finding a creature or if it loses all its hit points, it dissipates harmlessly. When the spell ends, all the wraiths dissipate in such a way.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may create an additional wraith for each slot level above 4th.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You attempt to scorch a creature you can see within range with a powerful bolt. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the target survives this damage, the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the target is killed by this spell, its remains are turned into a scorched effigy wreathed in electric energy. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause electricity to arc from the effigy to each creature within 20 feet of it. Each creature in range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, for the duration, you can cast spells that deal lightning damage as though you were in the effigy's space, but you must use your own senses.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the lightning damage of both the initial effect and the bonus action effect increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You bestow your allies with supernatural reflexes, making them ready to react to the slightest hint of danger. Choose up to five willing creatures in range. If one of the creatures would make a Dexterity saving throw or an initiative roll, its reflexes kick in and grant it advantage on the roll. If this causes the creature to succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, they instead take no damage. Whenever the effects of the spell are triggered for a creature, the creature then has its speed doubled until the end of its next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature can only safely benefit from this spell once every 24 hours. For every successive casting beyond the first, the affected creatures suffers a level of exhaustion.</p>

			<p>You blast foes with vicious red lightning, charged with negative energy. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 lightning damage and 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A living creature that fails the save is suffused with necrotic energy. Whenever such a creature would regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, it instead gains half as many. A Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or Wish spell can end this effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the lightning damage and the necrotic damage each increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.</p>

			<p>You channel calamitous voltage through your body, allowing you to briefly become lightning itself. For the spell's duration, you are immune to lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action on each of your turns, you transform into lightning and instantly travel in a straight line up to 300 feet in any direction, rematerializing at the end of the line. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Objects in the line take the damage as well. If an object would block the path of the line as you travel along it, if it takes enough damage from this spell to destroy a 5-foot square path through it, you can continue traveling. Otherwise, you materialize in front of the obstruction.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you rematerialize while in mid-air, you may levitate in that space until the end of your next turn or until you transform into lightning again, as arcs of electricity hold you aloft.</p>

			<p>You imbue the weapon used in the spell’s casting with flame and make a ranged attack with it against one creature within its range. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects and you can cause fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d4 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

		<description>
			<p>You create a poison of legendary potency that few can survive. The poison is initially held in an empty hand. You can deliver the poison as a melee spell attack when you cast the spell. If the spell attack is unsuccessful, you can try again on subsequent turns for 8 hours as long as you do not use the hand for anything else.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can use it to coat a single weapon or piece of ammunition, apply it to a portion of food or drink, or an object or surface that is up to 1 foot square area by touching it with the hand used. Regardless of the method, a creature that touches, is injured by, or ingests the targeted object or area can be affected by the poison, unless it is immune to the poisoned condition or this spell. If applied to an object, the poison lasts for 8 hours before becoming inert. You are immune to your own Mortal Tear poison.</p>
			<p>The first non-immune creature exposed to the tear is affected by the spell, and must make a Constitution saving throw immediately and at the end of each of its turns. The affected creature takes 8d12 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Additionally:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>0</i></b>If it fails a save, the creature is poisoned until the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>0</i></b>If it fails saves two times, the creature is incapacitated until the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>0</i></b>If it fails saves three times, the creature dies and the spell ends.</p>
			<p>If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. Each casting of this spell can only affect one creature.</p>

Doing so provides advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve looking at small details of an object or creature up to 100 feet away. Your field of view though the lens is narrow, so it does not provide advantage when the check involves looking around you to spot something (E.g: Finding a creature that you can hear but cannot see).</p>
			<p class="indent">You can also attack with the lens, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the lens at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the lens shatters in a burst of cold and the target takes 3d6 cold damage.</p>

The frozen surface can support large and smaller creatures. The liquid remains frozen even after the trail you create vanishes, but it usually melts after 1 minute. The DM may rule that certain liquids cannot be frozen by this spell (Typically ones at extremely high temperature, such as a lava flow).</p>

While encased in this way, the creature is restrained and unable to breathe or speak. The target is also immune to damage from the outside while it remains frozen. The block of ice is an object with an AC of 12 and 30 hit points, is vulnerable to fire, and destroying it ends the effects for the creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">When this spell is used against a creature that is huge or larger, only part of the creature is frozen. This means that it remains able to breathe and speak on a failed save, but rather than being immune to damage it gains half cover for the duration.</p>
			<p class="indent">To break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check as an action against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes, is no longer restrained and can talk and breathe.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the cold damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 6th.</p>

    <supports>Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>A cluster of massive ice shards bursts out of the ground at an angle, skewering enemies and creating a temporary fortification. The palisade is shaped like a ramp, and is up to 80 feet long, 20 feet thick and 20 feet high on the outward side. One side has a slope with carved steps leading up, which creatures can walk up normally. The opposite side is practically a spiked wall 20 feet high. You can orient the slope in any direction as long as its base remains in contact with the ground and the entirety of it is in range of the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast the spell, each creature in the area of the palisade must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 piercing damage, 5d8 cold damage and is pushed out to the spiked end of the ramp. A creature that succeeds the save takes half as much damage and can choose to either be pushed as a failed save or stay in their space and rise with the slope. If there is no room for a creature to be pushed on the far side of the slope, it is instead pushed into the nearest empty space. Additionally, when casting, you can choose any number of creatures you can see. These creatures automatically succeed on the save and take no damage rather than half.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wall is an object with AC 12 and 80 hit points per 10-foot section lengthwise, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. The spiked end of the wall can be climbed as normal, with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, but any creature doing so takes 1d8 piercing damage for each 5 feet climbed this way.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the maximum dimensions of the wall each double, the spell no longer requires concentration and the wall remains until dispelled. However, in temperatures above freezing, the wall will melt into water over the course of 4d4 hours.</p>

    <supports>Warlock, Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You conjure five shards of black ice from Stygia, fifth layer of the Nine Hells, which launch themselves at your foes. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each shard. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 cold damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Stygia is said to be the formed from the frozen floes of the river Styx, and thus this ice also carries the Styx's memory-altering power. Any creature hit by one or more of the shards must make a Wisdom saving throw or forget the events of the last 10 minutes. Even though the creature forgets the fact that the spell was cast upon it, if it took damage from the spell, it will likely realize quickly that something happened due to its injuries. A creature that is immune to cold damage or charm effects is also immune to this effect.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any number of the shards you create can instead be tiny needles. Any creature hit by one of these needles takes no damage, but still suffers the spell's other effects and additionally does not automatically notice that a hostile action occurred against it.</p>

			<p>You plunge a targeted area into a brutally cold night that is unrivaled by any on the material plane. Freezing magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 40-foot radius sphere for the duration. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area.</p>
			<p>When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 10d6 cold damage and have its speed reduced by 20 feet while it remains in the area. This speed penalty can accumulate over multiple turns, and can reduce a creature's speed to 0. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and its speed is not reduced. A creature that is immune to cold damage automatically succeeds on this save.</p>
			<p>A creature that ends its turn in the area without moving from its space is covered in a sheet of ice. While encased in this way, the creature is restrained and unable to breathe or speak. The target is also immune to damage from the outside while it remains frozen, but it continues taking damage from the spell. The sheet of ice is an object with an AC of 12 and 30 hit points, is vulnerable to fire, and destroying it frees the creature as if it broke out. To break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check as an action against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes, is no longer restrained and can talk and breathe, and the penalty to its speed is removed.</p>
			<p>Corpses in the area and other nonmagical objects made of organic material that aren't being worn or carried are transmuted into solid ice. Corpses of creatures transmuted in this way can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.</p>
			<p>As a bonus action, you can move the center of the area up to 20 feet.</p>

			<p>You bestow a creature you touch with a special sense, allowing it to detect the heartbeats of creatures within 30 feet. The target learns of their presence of such creatures as well as where they are located. This does not detect creatures without a heartbeat, which includes constructs and most undead. The target can also sense if such creatures are afraid, excited, calm or unconscious, but gains no other additional insight into their emotional state.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever the affected creature hits a creature whose heartbeat it can sense with a weapon attack, the attack is guided to strike at the heart. The attack deals an additional 1d6 necrotic damage and the critical range of the attack expands by 2 (So, an attack that normally crits on a natural 20 only would instead crit on a natural roll of 18-20).</p>

		<description>
			<p>You gain the ability to speak to the echoes present in bone, flesh and sinew, whether dead or undead.</p>
			<p class="indent">First, this causes some undead to see you as one of their own: for the duration, mindless undead do not automatically attack you, except in self defense, and you have advantage on Charisma checks against all undead. However, this does not stop a creature controlling the undead from commanding them to attack you. Mindless undead are typically those with an Intelligence of 7 or less, as opposed to intelligent undead. This distinction is ultimately at the discretion of the DM, however, as some undead function differently.</p>
			<p class="indent">Second, until the spell ends, you can converse with corpses and mindless undead, including asking them questions. A corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body. Thus, a corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.</p>
			<p class="indent">On the other hand, when conversing with a mindless undead creature, it also remembers events that happened while it was reanimated. You can convince such undead to do things, including moving or taking actions, as if they were thinking creatures through conversation and/or skill checks. However, they cannot go against any commands that they normally would have to follow, and cannot be convinced at all if they received such a command from another creature within the last minute, such as through the animate dead spell.</p>

			<p>Choose an allied creature within range. Whenever this creature moves a total of 30 feet or gets hit by an attack it gains a d6 discharge dice. When the spell ends, spend all discharge dice. All creatures in a 20 foot radius centered on the allied creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes lightning damage equal to the discharge dice spent on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally the targeted creature may use its action to end the spell early, spending all discharge dice. A line of 50 feet long and 5 feet wide shoots out from the creature in a direction of their choice. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes lightning damage equal to the discharge dice spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, choose an additional ally within range per two spell slots above 3rd.</p>

			<p>For the duration, whenever you deal lightning damage, gain a d6 discharge dice.</p>
			<p class="indent">As long as you have at least 4 discharge dice, you deal 1d6 lightning damage to any creature that hits you with a melee attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">As long as you have at least 8 discharge dice, you may reroll any 1's you roll for lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">You may end this spell as an action. This spell also ends as soon as you have 12 discharge dice. When this spell ends, spend all discharge dice and a target creature within 120 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save it takes half the damage of the discharge dice spent. On a failed save it takes the full damage and the lightning forks to a second target within 20 feet, forcing it to make the same saving throw. This continues until a creature saves or the spell has no more valid targets. No creature can be hit twice by this effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the maximum amount of discharge dice before the spell automatically ends is increased by 4 for every spell slot above 5th</p>

			<p>You conjure up a 5 foot sphere of concentrated static energy at a point within range. At the end of each of your turns, the closest creature within 15 feet to the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 6d6 lightning damage on a fail, or half damage on a success. If two or more creatures are equally close to the sphere, the target is determined randomly.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action you may move the ball up to 30 feet, generating two d6 discharge dice.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action you may spend any amount of discharge dice, empowering the sphere's next strike by an equal amount. If at least 6 discharge dice are spent this way, the target of the strike is also stunned for a turn, if they fail the save.</p>
			<p class="indent">The sphere constantly emits bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an extra 20 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot above 7th.</p>
