			<p>At your command, the lifeless body of a recently deceased creature swiftly swells and bursts into a horrifying explosion. You choose a corpse of a creature that has been lifeless for no more than 1 minute that you can see within range, triggering an explosion. Each creature within a 10-footradius sphere centered on that corpse must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">The size of the explosion increases by 5 feet for every size larger than medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

			<p>You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature you can see within range. A construct or an undead is immune to this effect. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the spell ends. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years.

		<description>
			<p>You create a sudden eruption of acidic energy at a point you can see within range. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 acid damage, and their skin is temporarily weakened, causing them to take an additional 1d4 acid damage at the start of each of their turns for the duration of the spell, or until they take an action to wipe off the acid. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not affected by the ongoing acid damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">While you maintain concentration on this spell, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the point of origin up to 30 feet in any direction. Any creature that starts its turn within the area of effect must make the initial Dexterity saving throw, even if they have already taken damage from the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd. Additionally, the ongoing acid damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

		<supports>Cleric, Druid, Warlock</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You point at a non-magical weapon within range and curse it with the bane of blades. The weapon begins to rust and corrode, losing its edge and becoming useless in combat. For the duration of the spell, targeted nonmagical weapons that are held by creatures or that are not being worn or carried take damage from rust and corrosion at the end of their wielder's turn. The number of turns a weapon can withstand this spell without breaking depends on the material of the weapon, as shown in the table below:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td class="left">Material</td><td>Durability(Turns)</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td class="left">Wood</td><td>1</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Bone</td><td>1</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Stone</td><td>2</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Iron</td><td>3</td></tr>

				<tr><td class="left">Silver</td><td>4</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Gold</td><td>5</td></tr>
				<tr><td class="left">Steel</td><td>5</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p class="indent">If a weapon's durability is reduced to zero, it is destroyed. If the wielder of a weapon affected by this spell leaves the area of the spell, the spell ends for the weapon, and the weapon reverts back to its undamaged version. If a weapon is destroyed before the end of the spell, it is destroyed permanently. Additionally, if a weapon is thrown or moved outside of the spell's area of effect, the spell ends on that weapon. You cannot target the same weapon multiple times with this spell, even if you cast it with a higher-level spell slot. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the number of weapons you can target increases by one for each spell slot level above 2nd.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You seek guidance from the fates by performing the ancient ritual of spilling molten lead into water. When you cast this spell, you heat up the lead until it becomes molten, and then pour it into the vessel of water</p>
			<p class="indent">As the molten lead cools and solidifies in the water, it forms unique shapes and patterns that can be interpreted as omens or messages from the divine. You can make an Intelligence check to interpret the significance of the shapes and patterns, with the DC determined by the GM based on the complexity of the interpretation.</p>
			<p class="indent">The interpretation can provide insight into a specific question or situation you are facing, or it can reveal general guidance or warnings. The interpretation is not always clear or definitive, and the GM has the final say on the outcome of the divination.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you gain advantage on the Intelligence check to interpret the divination.</p>

			<p class="indent">When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw.

			<p>You perform the ancient art of Haruspicina, using the entrails of a sacrificial animal to gain insight into the future. When you cast this spell, you must have access to the entrails of a recently deceased animal, which you use to divine the signs and portents of the future.</p>
			<p class="indent">As you perform the divination, you toss the divination bones or knucklebones, interpreting the patterns and symbols they form to reveal information about future events. The GM provides you with information about potential events that could happen in the near future, such as battles, natural disasters, or political upheavals.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can ask five specific questions about future events or seek general guidance on how to prepare for the future. The GM provides answers to these questions based on the results of the divination, although the answers may be cryptic or vague.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll a d100 to see the prophetic capabilities of the carcass you are inspecting. If you are using the carcass of a recently dead humanoid, you don't need to roll; the roll is assumed to be a 100 without a roll. Any carcass this spell is cast on cannot be revived with a spell below 7th level. Then roll an Insight check to interpret the results. Interpretation of the results gets harder as the depth of the knowledge you seek increases.</p>

For the duration of the spell, the target's clothing changes with them when they use a shapechanging ability, such as the Druid's Wild Shape or the Changeling's Shapechanger trait. This has the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The target gains a +2 bonus to AC while in their alternate form, as their clothing adjusts to provide optimal protection.</li>
				<li>The target's clothing also changes appearance to match their new form, giving them proficiency in utilizing their armor.</li>
				<li>The target can expend a bonus action to cause their clothing to return to its original form if desired.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, if the target is transformed by a spell or effect that does not allow them to maintain their equipment, such as the Polymorph spell, the Shapechanger's Raiment spell allows them to maintain their clothing and any small objects they are carrying (such as a wand or potion) while transformed. These items too shape change to allow the new form to utilize them.</p>

			<p>You call upon the spirits of the dead, drawing power from a magical onyx tablet that you create, which dot the plains. When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph of dark energy onto the surface of the tablet and place it on the ground. For the duration of the spell, as long as you are within 60 feet of the tablet, you can channel the power of the dead through this glyph, empowering your spells and abilities.</p>
			<p class="indent">While concentrating on this spell, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can add your proficiency bonus to the damage of any spell that deals necrotic damage.</li>
				<li>As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot and create a blast of necrotic energy that emanates from the glyph. The blast deals necrotic damage equal to five times the level of the spell slot expended, and all creatures within a 30-foot radius of the glyph must make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, a creature gets half damage. Undead creatures in the area automatically fail this saving throw.</li>
				<li>You can use your bonus action to summon a ghostly warrior to fight at your side. The warrior has the same statistics as a specter, except that it is immune to necrotic damage and gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to your proficiency bonus. The warrior remains for 8 hours or until it is destroyed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">The glyph of dark energy created by this spell is visible to all creatures within 60 feet of it and can be targeted and destroyed with a successful dispel magic spell. Additionally, this spell draws on the power of the dead and may attract unwanted attention from undead creatures or necromancers.</p>

			<p>This spell allows the caster and up to 5 willing creatures to teleport across any distance on the same plane of existence by stepping into one fire and emerging from another. The fire used as the entry point must be large enough for a creature to step into, such as a sizable fireplace or campfire.</p>
			<p class="indent">When cast on an appropriate fire, the flames take on a deep purple hue and cease to produce heat. The caster must then speak the name of a specific location known to them. The fire briefly flares, and any creature that steps into it emerges from the nearest suitable fire to the specified destination.</p>
			<p class="indent">However, if the caster is uncertain whether there is a suitable fire at the destination, the teleportation can be risky, potentially resulting in a significant distance from the intended location. Additionally, upon arrival, the flames at the exit point turn purple and cool for 30 seconds, which may startle those unprepared for the transition.</p>
			<p class="indent">It takes one full turn for a creature to step through the fire, preventing any actions on the other side for that round. Furthermore, the passage is one-way, meaning that nothing from the destination side can pass through to the entry side.</p>

			<p class="indent">This spell does not require concentration, and its effects are permanent unless the resurrected creature is destroyed or you choose to end the spell. Ending the spell does not cause the creature to revert to its original state; it simply collapses into a lifeless corpse once more.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, you can summon your thralls by recasting this spell. You select from your shadows the persons you will call forth. There is no limit for this spell; neither how many thralls you can enslave, or how many of them you can summon.</p>

			<p class="indent">Additionally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fail the casting, wasting the spell slot. Undead and constructs can't be affected by this spell.</p>

			<p>You invoke an ancient and forbidden ritual, calling upon the primordial forces of darkness to shroud all realms in eternal night. As you complete the 48 hour-long incantation, the magical components disintegrate into a swirling vortex of shadows, and an impenetrable darkness spreads from your location, encompassing all planes of existence.</p>
			<p class="indent">The darkness created by this spell is a magical darkness that overrides all natural and magical light sources, making it impossible for creatures to see through it using darkvision. Only those with true sight or a similar ability can perceive normally in this darkness. Once the spell is cast, the following effects take place:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Darkness Coverage. </i></b>The darkness covers all areas, both indoors and outdoors, across all planes. This magical darkness is absolute and cannot be illuminated or dispelled by conventional means.</li>
				<li><b><i>Duration. </i></b>The darkness persists indefinitely, remaining until it is dispelled by a god-like entity, divine intervention, or a similarly powerful means.</li>
				<li><b><i>Impenetrable Darkness. </i></b>This magical darkness is absolute, rendering all creatures within it effectively blind unless they have true sight or a similar ability. Any light sources, whether magical or non-magical, are snuffed out and provide no illumination.</li>
				<li><b><i>Undead Empowerment. </i></b>Undead creatures within this magical darkness, gains advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Additionally, they regenerate 10 hit points at the start of their turn if they have at least 1 hit point remaining.</li>
				<li><b><i>Daylight Sensitivity. </i></b>Creatures with sunlight sensitivity or sunlight hypersensitivity (such as drow, duergar, and vampires) are also gains advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. </li>
				<li><b><i>Night Creatures. </i></b>Eldritch Moons are used by the evil to call forth aberrations known as Night Creatures. Furthermore, the Eldritch Moons' effects are now permanent and will always be regarded as night. From now on, there will always be an Eldritch Moon in the night, and when one night comes to an end and another begins, the Moon will change into a different Eldrith form.</li>

			<p>Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll during the spell's duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the dбs rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed. A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.</p>
